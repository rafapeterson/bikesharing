* The average trip duration was short - less than 20 minutes. From this, it can be inferred that riders aren't using the bikes as an all-day traffic alternative, but rather for short trips.![NYC Citi Bikes Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13009587/146294898-6f09f58a-6605-43ad-84ff-f1035f74eed4.png)

* The majority of rentals took place in morning & evening rush hours. If consideration for maintenance is a concern, it would be advisable to perform any maintenance after evening rush hour, most efficiently between midnight-5am.
Along with these findings, a major consideration should be placed on where the bike rental spots would be located. It would be advisable to concentrate them in the touristy areas of the city. Since downtown is usually a prime tourist location, the majority of bikes should be situated around that area. This will target not only tourists, but hungry workers in the area popping out for a quick bite to eat.<br>![NYC Citi Bikes Analysis (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13009587/146294986-970f140d-4e51-4c7e-9102-0d9bda16090a.png)![NYC Citi Bikes Analysis (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13009587/146294991-ab9d48e2-35ab-4686-ae05-c439e5127ff4.png)

Along with this data, it would be wise to review other ride sharing platforms in the Des Moines area to determine a) how successful current ride sharing programs are & b) where the majority of their business is located within the city. Further, a review of traffic patterns in the area will help to establish an efficient maintenance program, if implemented on off hours.
<br> Overall, a bike rental program in Des Moines would be a great, ecofriendly alternative to other ride share options. With further analysis the logistics can be determined in the most efficient manner.
